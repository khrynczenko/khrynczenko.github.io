# About me

Hi, I am Krzysztof Hrynczenko and I am a programmer.
Throughout the years I have
and I am still gathering a lot of knowledge. I made this blog as a place where
I can store it and share it with others.  
I started programming in high school with Pascal and C and initially I did not
like it at all. After some time something clicked and I got passionate about it.
I try to explore anything that I find interesting. Nowadays it is compilers,
deep learning and functional programming. Tomorrow it may be games or
cryptography, who knows. When it comes to languages I feel quite comfortable
with C++ and Python and I try to get into Rust and Haskell. Rust because I just
find it so robust and Haskell just because it feels cool.

Oh and the thing that I am always interested in is writing great code.

You can find more about me on my LinkedIn and GitHub pages.
